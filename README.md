 my pc has an outro :skull: \

**DISCLAIMER:** THIS WILL SHUTDOWN YOUR COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY. AS MENTIONED IN	THE PROGRAM ITSELF TOO, PLEASE SAVE ALL UNSAVED WORK, AND EXIT ALL APPS BEFORE RUNNING. I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR STUPIDITY.

## How to use:
Firstly you need to install the required python modules.
```bash
pip install pydub os
```

or 
```bash
python3 -m pip install pydub os
```

Then get the appropriate file.\
For Windows (yuck) computers get the `outro_WIN.py` \
For Linux/MacOS computers get the `outro_NIX.py` \
The only difference is the shutdown commands between the operating systems.

By default there is no audio because copyright exists but you can use any audio file that's named `outro.mp3` (you can change this in the program). \

Simply place the audio in the same folder as the program. \

(FYI the outro music you're hearing these days in the tiktoks is Xenogenesis by TheFatRat.)

To run:
```bash
python3 outro.py
```

This program is GPLv3 so feel free to basically do whatever you want with it. (actual legal terms given in `LICENSE`)
